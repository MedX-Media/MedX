## How to Contribute?
You are free to contribute to the MedX open-source project based on your interests and abilities, wherever you "want" and "can".

### Want to contribute to website development?
1. Fork the repository  
    Fork the repository to your own GitHub account to get started:
    - Go to the [MedX repository](https://github.com/MedX-Media/MedX) on GitHub.
    - Click the "Fork" button at the top of the page to create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.
2. Clone the Repository  
    After forking the repository, clone it to your local machine so you can make changes:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MedX.git
    ```
    Make sure to replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username.

    - After cloning the Django project from GitHub, follow these steps to set up the project, create necessary content, and avoid potential issues due to an empty database:
        1. Change directory to website code root  
            ```
            cd MedX\src\medx_website\
            ```
        2. Migrate the Database  
        Since the database is not included in the repository, you need to apply migrations to set up the necessary database tables:  
            ```
            python manage.py migrate
            ```
        3. Create a Superuser  
        Create a superuser to access the Django admin panel:  
            ```
            python manage.py createsuperuser
            ```
            You’ll be prompted to enter a username, email, and password. Remember these credentials for logging into the admin panel.  
            
        4. Run the Development Server  
        After setting up the database and creating the superuser, start the Django development server:  
            ```
            python manage.py runserver
            ```
        5. Access the Admin Panel  
        Open your browser and navigate to the admin login page:  
            ```
            http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
            ```
            Log in using the superuser credentials you created earlier.  

        6. Create Necessary Content  
        Once logged into the admin panel, create at least one post to ensure the website functions properly. This step is essential to avoid errors due to missing data on the home page or other sections.

3. Head over to the [issues section](https://github.com/MedX-Media/MedX/issues)  
    Browse the list of issues in the repository. Look for issues labeled "development," and choose the one you'd like to contribute to. Be sure to communicate your intent to work on an issue by commenting on it.
4. Create a New Branch  
    Before making any changes, create a new branch to work on. It’s a good practice to create a separate branch for each issue or feature:
    ```
    git checkout -b issue-name
    ```
    Replace issue-name with a descriptive name that relates to the issue or feature you’re working on.
5. Consider Development Principles:
    - Programming:
        - Check out [MedX src directory](https://github.com/MedX-Media/MedX/tree/main/src)
        - Write clean and well-organized code as much as possible.
        - Comment your code to ensure others can easily understand it.
    - Designing:
        - Check out [MedX design directory](https://github.com/MedX-Media/MedX/tree/main/design)
        - Design your ideas with any tools you want such as Figma, Photoshop, etc.
        - Put your output in the directory with a suitable file name.
6. Add and Commit Your Changes  
    Once you've made the necessary changes, stage and commit them to your local repository:
    ```
    git add .
    ```
    ```
    git commit -m "A brief description of your changes"
    ```
7. Push Changes to Your Fork  
    Push your changes to the forked repository in your GitHub account:
    ```
    git push origin issue-name
    ```
8. Submit a Pull Request  
    Once your changes are pushed to your fork, it's time to submit a pull request:
    - Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
    - Click the "Pull Request" button.
    - Select the MedX `development` branch as the **base** and `your` branch as the **compare**.
    - Write a detailed description of the changes you made, explaining how it resolves the issue or contributes to the project.
    - Submit the pull request.
9. That's it! You've contributed to MedX as a developer.

# Setup Pre-Commit Hook for Code Formatting

## Introduction
This document outlines the steps to set up a pre-commit hook for automatic code formatting in our project. By implementing this hook, we can ensure that all code is properly formatted before it is committed to the repository.

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure that the following tools are installed:

- **Python** (and pip)
- **Node.js** (and npm)
- **Black** (for Python formatting)
- **Prettier** (for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript formatting)
- **isort** (for sorting Python imports)

## Steps to Create a Pre-Commit Hook

### 1. Navigate to the Git Hooks Directory
Go to the `.git/hooks` directory in your project:
```bash
cd .git/hooks
```

### 2. Create the Pre-Commit File
Create a new file named `pre-commit`:
```bash
touch pre-commit
```

### 3. Add Formatting Commands
Open the `pre-commit` file in a text editor and add the following code:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

# Format Python files with Black
echo "Formatting Python files..."
black .

# Format HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files with Prettier
echo "Formatting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files..."
npx prettier --write "**/*.html" "**/*.css" "**/*.js"

# Sort imports for Python files
echo "Sorting imports in Python files..."
isort .

echo "Pre-commit formatting done."
```

### 4. Make the Pre-Commit File Executable
Make the `pre-commit` file executable by running:
```bash
chmod +x pre-commit
```

### 5. Testing the Pre-Commit Hook
To test the pre-commit hook, make some changes to your code and then attempt to commit:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Test pre-commit hook"
```

### 6. Additional Notes
- Ensure that **Black** and **Prettier** are installed as dependencies in your project.
- You can customize the pre-commit hook by adding any other formatting or linting tools you prefer.

## Conclusion
By following these steps, you can set up a pre-commit hook that automatically formats your code before each commit. This helps maintain code quality and consistency across the project.

## Issues

### What Are Issues? Why Do We Need Them?
Issues are tasks or improvements identified by the community to enhance the project. They help to keep track of bugs, enhancements, and features.

### When to Create an Issue?
An issue should be created when:
- You want to start working on something.

2. Click the "New Issue" button.
3. Set the title and description as clear and detailed as possible.
4. Specify other details:
    - **Assignee**: Every issue must be assigned to at least one person. This could be yourself or a team of people.
    - **Label**: Apply at least one label to every issue. Use correct labels that accurately reflect the issue's nature.  
        For example:  
        - 'good first issue': Suitable for new contributors.  
        - 'bug': Reports a defect or error.  
        - 'enhancement': Suggests a new feature or improvement.
    - **Project**: Select the relevant project the issue belongs to.
